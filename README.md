# Gavoja's JSFX Plugins

## Helix Control

Line 6 Helix can be controlled with MIDI CC messages however managing those in Reaper's MIDI editor is cumbersome. This plugin translates notes to CC messages according to a configurable mapping, which allows to use notes in the editor instead.

## Lowpass Bypass

Low pass filter with bypass, i.e. does not process if frequency is kept at 20 kHz.

## Lumpy

A massive granular synthesizer inspired by Quanta. Supports simultaneous playback of up to 150 grains, allowing for a rich wall-of-sound type of ambients.

Place your samples in `Data/lumpy` folder inside Reaper's root.

## Mixer

A 4-channel stereo mixer with bypass for each channel.

## Reverse

Reverse audio up to 30 seconds.

## Sweep

A simple sweep effect.
